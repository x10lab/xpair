    // ── host notification hook mirror (for cask-only hosts) ────────────────────────────────────
    //
    // Why: notification delivery starts with the host's Claude Code hook (remote-pair-notify.sh) writing events to a queue.
    //   install.sh (--role host) lays this down, but a host that received only the .app via cask never went through
    //   install.sh and has no hook → the client receives no notifications. So app self-install mirrors it the same way the CLI does.
    //
    // Approach (consistent with the approve/notify hook section of shared/install.sh):
    //   Source lookup order ① app bundle Contents/Helpers/hooks ② repo HOST_DIR/hooks (dev/source tree)
    //   If neither is present (pure cask + repo unreachable) → graceful skip: just log and pass.
    //   Install locations (character-for-character identical to install.sh — guarantees reversibility): notify.sh → $RP_DIR/bin/remote-pair-notify.sh,
    //             manage-claude-hooks.py → $RP_DIR/bin/ (idempotent JSON merger, same as install.sh)
    //   Registration: manage-claude-hooks.py add <settings> <approve_cmd> <notify_cmd> — preserves existing user hooks (idempotent).
    //     notify_cmd is registered with the same absolute path as install.sh ($RP_DIR/bin/remote-pair-notify.sh) →
    //     uninstall.sh's path-keyed remove (manage-claude-hooks.py remove) removes it exactly by the same key regardless of
    //     whether the CLI or the app registered it (blocks reversibility leaks).
    //   If python3 is absent, skip (install the skill/notification scripts but defer only hook registration) — the same conservative handling as install.sh.
    //
    // Reversibility (cask-only): a pure cask host that did not go through install.sh has no install.sh manifest. So
    //   what is installed/registered here is appended directly to $RP_DIR/.install-manifest in the TAB format of
    //   shared/lib.sh record() (FILE notify.sh + FILE manage-claude-hooks.py [+ FILE approve-reminder.sh],
    //   HOOKS <settings> <cmd>). uninstall.sh globs .install-manifest and reverts in reverse order, so there is no leak.
    //   (A separate file from the .manifest-host laid down by install.sh — no duplication/conflict.)
