// ConnectedClients.swift — read-only view of which clients are currently connected.
//
// The CLIENT writes one heartbeat file per client at ~/.remote-pair/clients/<id>.json, shaped
// {"name":"<client hostname>","user":"<client user>","ts":<unix epoch seconds>}. A client counts as
// "connected" if its ts is within the freshness window of now. There is NO disconnect/revoke — this is
// read-only status. Reused by both the menu bar (AppDelegate.rebuildMenu) and the onboarding bridge
// (OnboardingWindow's `connectedClients` method). Foundation only.
