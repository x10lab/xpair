// SentryBridge.swift — host crash-reporting seam for XpairHost (telemetry-funnel spec, Sentry scope).
//
// PROTOCOL SEAM. The crash backend is swappable behind the CrashReporting protocol: NoopCrashReporter
// (zero network) by default, and a sentry-cocoa-backed SentryCrashReporter once consent + DSN are present.
// The host build links sentry-cocoa via SwiftPM (host/Package.swift, product "Sentry") and is driven by
// `swift build -c release` (build-host.sh). The real backend is compiled behind `#if canImport(Sentry)` so
// this file still compiles if the dependency is ever removed (falls back to staying no-op).
//
// Contract:
//   • init gated on RPCrashReportConsent; if DSN absent => do NOT init (no network — the SDK never starts).
//   • sendDefaultPii=false; disable server_name.
//   • beforeSend MUST run the STRICT outbound scrubber `outboundScrub()` (Config.swift) over every
//     outbound field (message, exception value, backtrace frames). outboundScrub() composes
//     logRedact() ($HOME/REMOTE_HOST) PLUS IPv4/IPv6 → <ip>, abs paths → <path>, *.ts.net → <host>.
//     Plain logRedact() is INSUFFICIENT here — crash payloads carry raw IPs/paths/tailnet names.
//   • release = APP_VERSION; RP_SESSION tag when available.
//   • NSException path: capture BEFORE the local dump write (CrashReporter.swift).
//   • Signal path stays async-signal-safe (local-only): CrashReporter.swift OWNS the signal handler, so
//     sentry-cocoa's own crash handler is DISABLED (options.enableCrashHandler = false). On next launch any
//     appended crash-host-signal.log is uploaded as a message envelope, then the local dump is KEPT.
//
// Default behavior (consent OFF, or DSN absent, or SDK absent): every method is a no-op => ZERO network calls.
