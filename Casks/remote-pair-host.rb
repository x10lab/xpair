  caveats <<~EOS
    RemotePairHost is self-signed (not notarized). After install you must grant,
    in System Settings → Privacy & Security:
      • Accessibility   → RemotePairHost  (ON)
      • Screen Recording → RemotePairHost (ON)
    These grants persist across updates as long as the signing identity is stable.
