# t_15_ext_js_contracts — run the VSCodium extension's *.test.js contract tests (onboarding bridge,
# host-update gate, remote-desktop, global.d.ts, etc.) under the shared CI harness.
#
# WHY: these *.test.js files were never wired into tests/run.sh (which only globs t_*.sh), so the
# only thing that ran them was a developer invoking node by hand. That let invariant drift slip
# through — e.g. the MIN_COMPATIBLE_HOST host-compatibility floor reading a49 in onboarding-bridge.js
# but a45 in App.tsx / this very test file. Running them here makes that drift a CI failure.
#
# Each *.test.js prints "ok"/"FAIL" lines and exits non-zero on any failure; we assert rc==0 per file.
