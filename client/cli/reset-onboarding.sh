# reset-onboarding.sh — revert this client to a fresh, pre-onboarding state.
#
# Philosophy: the onboarding app (and the launcher gate) always reflect REAL config state — there is
# no dev "force onboarding" flag. To test the onboarding flow from scratch you reset to a genuinely
# empty state with this script, then launch the app, which will behave exactly as a clean install.
#
# What it does (client-side only — never touches the host):
#   1. Unmounts any Xpair mounts under ~/.xpair/host/mounts and removes the leftover dirs.
#   2. Clears the onboarding-produced keys in ~/.xpair/host/client.env (REMOTE_HOST, FOLDER_MAPS,
#      SYNC_BACKEND, MOUNT_BACKEND) while preserving install-level keys (LAUNCHER, TERMINAL_APP).
#   3. Leaves the SSH key (~/.ssh/id_ed25519) in place by default — onboarding reuses it. Pass
#      --keys to also remove it for a truly bare state.
#
# Usage: reset-onboarding.sh [-y|--yes] [--keys]
