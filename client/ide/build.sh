# Vendor separation (Option C): vendor/vscodium/ is PRISTINE VSCodium (git subtree from
# github.com/VSCodium/vscodium). Everything Xpair owns lives in remotepair/.

# (trap-cleaned so vendor stays byte-pristine for the next `git subtree pull`), then runs
# the Xpair build orchestrator with CWD = the recipe root.
