# Set up file access

Choose how this client reaches the host's files. Pick **one** primary backend:

- **Open Remote - SSH (recommended)** — edit the host filesystem *directly*, no
  syncing. **Connect to Host** opens the host's folders and a terminal attached
  to the host's `tmux-aqua` session (where Claude runs). Nothing to map.

- **Folder mapping + sync** — keep a local copy that stays in sync with the host
  (Syncthing by default). Register which local folder maps to which host folder so
  the launcher knows where each project lives on the host.

- **Mount** — mount a host folder onto this client over `smb`/`sshfs`
  (`SYNC_BACKEND=mount`), an alternative to Syncthing.

**Run setup** configures all of this interactively (host, terminal app, **folder
mapping**, and a doctor check) via the `xpair onboard` CLI. You can also run
these directly in a terminal:

```
xpair onboard                      # interactive: host + folder mapping + doctor
xpair map add <localDir> <hostDir> # register one mapping (omit hostDir = same path)
xpair mount mount <hostPath>       # mount a host folder (smb/sshfs)
xpair mount status                 # show active mounts
```

Mappings persist in `~/.xpair/host/client.env` (`FOLDER_MAPS`). Re-run
`xpair onboard` anytime to change them.
