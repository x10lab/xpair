<p align="center"><b>English</b> · <a href="README.ko.md">Korean</a></p>

Run the agent you already subscribe to — **Claude**, **Codex**, or **OpenCode** — on an always-on Mac, with full macOS **computer-use** (screenshot, click, type) intact, and attach to it from your laptop or phone over mosh/SSH. Your work keeps running while you're away; you bring your own subscription, so there are no extra AI credits.

</p>

- **Host Mac** — runs your agent inside persistent tmux sessions, 24/7, with computer-use working.
- **Client** — **Xpair**, the desktop app (a VSCodium-based fork), or the `xpair` CLI; attach with a Finder right-click.
- **Mobile** — reach the same sessions from any SSH/mosh client, including Claude Code on your phone.

## Quick start — let Claude Code install it

Already have Claude Code? Paste the block below into a session **on the Mac you're setting up** and it drives the whole install end-to-end — figuring out the role, installing, wiring SSH, and walking you through the one manual permission step.

```text
Set up Xpair (https://github.com/x10lab/xpair) on this Mac. Fetch and read its README, then follow it. Figure out whether this Mac is the host or the client, explain each command before you run it, and stop for anything that needs my input or my physical screen (like the one-time permission grant). Finish with xpair doctor and a summary of what's left for me to do.
```

Prefer to do it by hand? See [Installation](#installation) below. Either way, first launch drops you into a guided **onboarding** flow (below) that walks the rest.

## Features

![Xpair architecture](assets/architecture.png)

### Computer-use that survives going remote
Run your agent over SSH and macOS strips its Accessibility (AX) and Screen Recording (SR) grants, so screenshot/click/type silently stop. A privileged menu-bar app (`XpairHost.app`) owns the grants and keeps the agent inside its process subtree, so computer-use keeps working no matter which client is attached.

### Sessions that survive disconnects
Close the laptop or drop Wi-Fi and a normal agent session dies with the connection. A patched tmux (`tmux-aqua`) keeps every session alive on the host — `Attached` while you're there, `Detached` while you're gone, running 24/7 either way.

### Pick your engine
Bring whichever subscription you have: `claude` (with its unique `--remote-control`), `codex`, or `opencode`. The agent runs on the host, so it must be installed there. Switch with `xpair config set engine <claude|codex|opencode>`, or override per launch with `xpair launch --engine <e>`.

### Onboarding that resolves, not just blocks
First run opens a guided setup where each step is a **hard gate that fixes itself** instead of dead-ending: it installs the CLI, `brew install`s the engine, sets the API key, and verifies SSH key-auth. Secrets go over stdin, never argv or disk.

### Attach from your laptop or your phone
Attach from a client Mac (Finder → right-click → *Launch Remote Pair*), Xpair's Sessions sidebar, or any SSH/mosh client including Claude Code on mobile. Same sessions, same state, wherever you are.

### Remote Desktop, built in
View and drive the host screen from Xpair's Remote Desktop tab over a native H.264/WebRTC stream with authenticated pointer, wheel, keyboard, and text input. `xpair desktop` falls back to macOS Screen Sharing.

### Permission dialogs answered for you
A blocking "Allow?" dialog (or a 1Password unlock prompt) on a headless host stalls the whole session. An on-demand approve router (OCR + click, with a Claude fallback classifier) detects and clicks the right button, so unattended sessions don't hang.

---

## Requirements

- Apple Silicon Mac (host and client)
- macOS Sequoia or later recommended
- **Remote Login** enabled on the host (onboarding generates the SSH key and wires the rest)
- `mosh` on both machines — onboarding installs it via Homebrew; without it, attach falls back to plain SSH (which dies on disconnect)
- **Host:** Homebrew. The engine CLI (`claude` / `codex` / `opencode`) and the host app are installed by onboarding.

---

## Installation

Setup runs from **Xpair**, the client app: install it, launch it, and its first-run onboarding does the rest — installs the CLI, wires SSH, installs and authenticates your engine on the host, and pushes the signed host app onto the host. Every step is a hard gate that fixes itself instead of dead-ending. The only thing it can't automate is the permission grant on the host's physical screen.

### 1. Install Xpair and launch it

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/x10lab/xpair/main/shared/install-client.sh | bash
```

This installs the latest **stable** release that actually includes the `Xpair.zip` client asset. Xpair currently has no stable release on the renamed Xpair asset line, so the installer falls back to the newest `0.5.0aN` **pre-release** with a notice. To choose that channel explicitly, pass `--prerelease`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/x10lab/xpair/main/shared/install-client.sh | bash -s -- --prerelease
```

It downloads the chosen `Xpair.app` and strips its Gatekeeper quarantine with `xattr` — exactly what the cask does in its postflight (Homebrew's `--no-quarantine`), so the self-signed app opens without the "unidentified developer" block.

Prefer Homebrew? The cask currently tracks the pinned `0.5.0aN` **pre-release** line (matching the `--prerelease` curl path, not the stable-default path):

```bash
brew tap x10lab/xpair https://github.com/x10lab/xpair && brew install --cask xpair
```

Open Xpair. First run opens onboarding (in-app, not a separate window) and walks:

- **CLI** — auto-installs the bundled `xpair` CLI if it's missing.
- **Connection** — generates an SSH key, discovers hosts (LAN Bonjour + Tailscale), and verifies passwordless reachability. You enable **Remote Login** on the host once (System Settings → General → Sharing); outside your LAN, a mesh VPN like [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) gives the host a stable name.
- **Engine** — probes the host for `claude` / `codex` / `opencode`, installs it if missing, and sets the API key. The key travels over SSH stdin — never argv, log, or disk.
- **Host app** — runs `xpair install-host`, copying the signed `XpairHost.app` to the host and installing its daemon (LaunchAgent, `~/.xpair/host`, tmux-aqua, watchdog). The app is self-signed but its grants stick to a stable signing identity.
- **Permissions** — polls the host's grant status and stops at the one manual step below.

> Coming from an old *RemotePair* build on the host? Uninstall it first — the bundle id changed, so its macOS permission grants don't carry over.

### 2. One-time permission grant — needs a physical screen or VNC

This is the one step onboarding can't do for you; it can't be done over SSH (TCC on SIP-enabled, non-MDM Macs). On the host, in **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, turn `XpairHost` ON for:

| Grant | Why | Needed? |
|---|---|---|
| **Accessibility** | Synthetic input (click/type) for computer-use | **Required** |
| **Screen Recording** | Screenshots for computer-use | **Required** |
| **Full Disk Access** | Prevents macOS folder prompts a headless host can't answer (an unanswered prompt stalls the session). The grant is exercised by the agent session running inside the app, which can then read the whole disk — prefer a non-protected project root instead if you can. | **Recommended** |

Then pick up the grants: `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.x10lab.xpair-host` (or menu bar → Restart tmux host).

> Prefer not to grant Full Disk Access? Keep project folders under a non-protected root (e.g. `~/Spaces`, not `~/Desktop`/`~/Documents`/`~/Downloads`) — then sessions never hit a protected folder and never prompt.

### Doing it by hand (CLI only)

Prefer the CLI to the app? The bootstrap script and `xpair install-host` do the same work (the bootstrap script needs `git` — it clones the repo for its source):

```bash
# Client: CLI + Finder Quick Action (auto-runs `xpair onboard`):
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/x10lab/xpair/main/shared/bootstrap.sh | ROLE=client bash

# Host: install the CLI + approve glue on the host itself:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/x10lab/xpair/main/shared/bootstrap.sh | ROLE=host bash

# Deliver the signed XpairHost.app onto the host from a configured client:
xpair install-host --host <user@host>
```

You normally don't download the host app yourself — the client carries the signed `XpairHost.app` and `xpair install-host` copies it over (the same step onboarding runs for you). It's still published as a release asset if you ever need it directly.

Uninstall: `~/.local/share/xpair/shared/uninstall.sh [--purge]`.

---

## Host files

Xpair runs your agent on the **host**, against files **on the host** — it attaches to a host path, it never copies your project around. The project lives on the host; the client just reaches it.

To browse and edit those files from the client, **mount the host folder**. In Xpair's Browser, *Add Root* mounts a host folder and adds it as a workspace root (`xpair mount` does the same from the CLI — see [docs/m-mount.md](docs/m-mount.md)). No syncing, no two copies to keep in step: there's one copy, on the host.

```bash
xpair launch <host-folder>   # start / attach a session for a folder on the host
xpair mount                  # mount a host folder locally (smb/sshfs) to browse + edit it
```

---

## Usage

```bash
xpair launch <dir>     # launch / attach a session for a folder (--engine to override)
xpair attach <name>    # attach an existing tmux-aqua session by exact name
xpair ls               # host sessions + folder mappings
xpair map add|rm|list  # client path ↔ host path mappings
xpair onboard          # re-runnable client setup (host, terminal, mappings, doctor)
xpair discover         # find Xpair/SSH hosts (LAN Bonjour + Tailscale)
xpair status           # app PID, host server, heartbeat age
xpair doctor           # check SSH auth, host app, tmux-aqua on host
xpair desktop open     # open the host screen via macOS Screen Sharing (vnc://)
xpair editor start     # launch the in-app code-server editor (loopback)
xpair mount            # mount a host folder directly (smb/sshfs)
xpair notify           # pull recent host notifications (Stop / approve / …)
xpair logs [--host -f] # tail launcher/app logs (or host logs over ssh)
xpair config set host my-mac-mini
xpair config set engine codex
```

Host-side / install helpers: `xpair install-host` (idempotent, integrity-verified remote install), `xpair update` / `xpair self-update` (hot-swap the glue layer without touching the signed `.app`), `xpair approve` (handle a blocked dialog), `xpair host` (ensure the tmux-aqua server is up).

`xpair launch <dir>` (or Finder → right-click → Quick Actions → *Launch Remote Pair*) starts/attaches the session; the only per-session prompt is the agent's own "Allow for this session" — press Enter once.

## Xpair, the client app

Xpair is a **VSCodium-based desktop app** (`xpair` cask) reshaped around remote pairing, on top of stock VSCodium:

- **Sessions sidebar** — lists your host sessions (Attached / Detached) with a session picker; the home base of the app.
- **Browser container** — folder / Search / Extensions with per-folder favorites.
- **Remote Desktop** — view and drive the host screen in-app over the native H.264/WebRTC pipeline (`host/rd`), including pointer, wheel, keyboard, and text input over the active RD session; `xpair desktop` remains a macOS Screen Sharing fallback.
- **First-run onboarding** — a guided, hard-gated flow that resolves each prerequisite (CLI install, engine, API key, SSH) before handing you the app.
- **Editor (code-server)** *(scaffold)* — an in-app editor over `xpair editor`, still being wired in.

Stock VSCodium stays inviolable — Xpair changes live only in `client/ide/remotepair/`, so upstream pulls stay conflict-free. See [`client/ide/remotepair/REMOTEPAIR.md`](client/ide/remotepair/REMOTEPAIR.md).

**Notifications:** the host hook (`host/hooks/xpair-notify.sh`, installed by bootstrap) appends Claude Code Stop/Notification events to `~/.xpair/host/notifications/queue.jsonl`; the client polls it over SSH (`xpair notify`).

---

## Security & responsibility

> ⚠️ Xpair deliberately lowers macOS's safety guardrails on the host: it holds Accessibility + Screen Recording (and optionally Full Disk Access) and keeps an autonomous agent running inside that privileged subtree, reachable remotely 24/7. That agent can see the screen, synthesize input, and — with Full Disk Access — read and write your entire disk. That is the point of the tool, and a trade-off you opt into. **You are solely responsible for what runs on the host.** Run it only on a personal machine you own, grant the minimum permissions you need, and don't point it at anything you can't afford to lose. Provided as-is, without warranty (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)).

**Telemetry is off by default.** Two independent opt-in switches (PostHog product analytics, Sentry crash reports) stay silent unless you turn them on, and never carry repo names, paths, command contents, or personal data. See [docs/logging.md §11](docs/logging.md) for the full event catalog.

---

## Troubleshooting

1. **`xpair doctor`** — checks SSH auth, the host app, and tmux-aqua; catches most setup problems.
2. **`xpair status`** + logs at `~/.xpair/host/logs/xpair.log` (or `xpair logs --host -f`).
3. **Computer-use stopped after an agent update?** Toggle the MCP server: `/mcp disable computer-use` then `/mcp enable computer-use`.
4. **Permissions look granted but computer-use fails?** Re-pick up the grants with the `launchctl kickstart` command above.

Still stuck? [Open an issue](https://github.com/x10lab/xpair/issues) with your version (`xpair status`), macOS version, `xpair doctor` output, and repro steps. Scrub secrets from logs first.

## For maintainers

Single monorepo (`host/` + `client/` + `shared/`), built in lockstep. Versions are declared once in `shared/identity/versions.json` (host **0.5.0**, client **0.1.0**, screen-engine **0.1.0**) and verified across consumers; everything is signed with one stable cert (the in-app Updater verifies the leaf CN). The host app is built first — **published to the release and bundled into the client**, which delivers it to the host via `xpair install-host`. `.github/workflows/release.yml` ships both; users install the client cask and let it push the host.

```bash
./host/build-host.sh                   # → build/XpairHost.app (signed + verified)
./client/ide/build.sh                  # → the Xpair client app (VSCodium fork)
shared/identity/check-identity.sh      # brand/version consistency
```
